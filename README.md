# first-mobile-application
This project is a simple mobile application built with Flutter to display real-time air quality data. It was developed as a personal assignment to practice API integration and custom UI/UX design.

The app fetches data from the [World Air Quality Index (WAQI) API](https://aqicn.org/api/) and presents it through a unique, self-designed user interface that changes based on the current AQI level.

An API token from the [WAQI Platform](https://aqicn.org/data-platform/token/).
